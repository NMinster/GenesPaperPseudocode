Algorithm A1 Pseudocode.
Let F be the total number of features
For r = 1 to 20 do
     Divide data into 10 stratified folds using random seed r
     for fold k = 1 to 10 do
         Set fold k as validation_set and the remaining 9 folds as training_set
         for s = 1 to 100 do
              Divide training_set into 5 stratified folds using random seed s
              Take 4 of the folds as the new training set
              Train a RF on this training set with 1000 trees
for f = 1 to F do
                    Set is_outlier r,s,f = 0
                    Estimate importance r,s,f
            end for
            Evaluate th r,s = MEDIAN(f) (importance r,s,f) + 1.5 ∗ IQR(f) (importance r,s,f) where MEDIAN(f) means median over the F values of f
            for f = 1 to F do
                    is_outlier r,s,f = IFELSE(importance r,s,f > th r,s, 1, 0)
            end for
         end for
         for f = 1 to F do
             Set percentage_outlier r,f = 0
             for s = 1 to 100 do
                    percentage_outlier r,f += is_outlier r,s,f
             end for
         end for
         for C = 1 to 100 do
             Evaluate is_selected r,f,C = IFELSE(percentage_outlier r,f > C, 1, 0)
             Train XGBoost on the training_set using only features f with is_selected r,f,C =1
             Estimate performance ROCAUC r,k,C on the validation_set
         end for
     end for
end for
for C = 1 to 100 do
     Evaluate m_ROCAUC r,C = MEDIAN(k)(ROCAUC r,k,C) over the 10 values of k
end for
for C = 1 to 100 do
     Evaluate m_ROCAUCC
 = MEDIAN(r)
(ROCAUC r,C) over the 20 values of r
end for
Let C∗= ARGMAXC (m_ROCAUCC)
For f = 1 to F do
     Set count_selectedf = 0
     for r = 1 to 20 do
         count_selectedf += is_selectedr,f,C∗
     end for
